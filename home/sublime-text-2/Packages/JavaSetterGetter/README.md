JavaSetterGetter
================

Sublime Text plugin that generates getters and setters for your class' properties
like other modern IDE's do.

The package by default installs a menu entry in the Tools menu, under Java.
It also comes bound to the Ctrl+K + Ctrl+J key combination sequence.

How to make it work:

- Select the properties from your class from which you want to generate
  getters and setters.
- Go to Tools->Java->Java Setter Getter (or hit the Ctrl+K + Ctrl+J sequence)
- Your getters and setters should be ready to go.

Hint: You can shift click on the location where
you want your getters and setters to be generated.
