The package by default installs a menu entry in the Tools menu, under Java.
It also comes bound to the Ctrl+K + Ctrl+J key combination sequence.

How to make it work:

- Select the properties from your class from which you want to generate
  getters and setters.

- Go to Tools->Java->Java Setter Getter (or hit the Ctrl+K + Ctrl +J sequence)
- Your getters and setters should be ready to go.

I'm still working out the kinks on indentation and automatically selecting
the newly generated text. This will hopefully be present in a future release.
